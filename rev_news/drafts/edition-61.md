### General

* [AGit-Flow and git-repo](https://git-repo.info/en/2020/03/agit-flow-and-git-repo/) (*written by Jiang Xin*)

  [AGit-Flow and git-repo](https://git-repo.info/en/2020/03/agit-flow-and-git-repo/)
  is a blog post on a missing speech from Git
  Merge 2020. Jiang Xin, a developer at Alibaba China, had planned to
  speak at the Git Merge 2020 conference, but cancelled his flight due
  to a coronavirus outbreak in China. He wrote this blog post about the
  topic he wanted to offer to the conference.

  In this blog post, he introduces a centralized workflow (named AGit-Flow)
  implemented at Alibaba, and an open source command-line tool "git-repo".
  "git-repo" is an open-source software host in GitHub:
  [https://github.com/alibaba/git-repo-go](https://github.com/alibaba/git-repo-go).
  It is not bound to a single protocol or a single server. It is
  extensible and can run on Gerrit, AGit-Flow or other compatible protocols.

  The implementation of AGit-Flow has been contributed to
  [the Git mailing list](https://public-inbox.org/git/20200304113312.34229-1-zhiyou.jx@alibaba-inc.com/),
  and this feature is under code review. Junio states that the name of
  the new hook is inappropriate. Therefore, after a code review of these
  patches, some updates will be made in the blog post.
